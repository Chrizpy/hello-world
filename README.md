# Hello world!

This repository will contain my personal website, where I will try and keep
information up to date about me, my career, what I'm up to etc.

## TODO

There are still quite a few things needed to be done here before I feel
satisfied with my effort:

- Learn more about component
  - So that I can DRY up my code and use better practises
- Populate the other routes with real content
- Learn more about frontend development!
- The design, I might have to give up here at some point, but I still need to
  fix the responsivness

### Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
